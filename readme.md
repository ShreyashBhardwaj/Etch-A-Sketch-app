# Etch A Sketch Mini Project

This project leverages Python's `turtle` module to create a simple application to control a turtle on the screen using keyboard commands. The program listens for specific key presses to move the turtle in different directions or reset it to its home position.

## Features

- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - Press **W** to move the turtle forward.
  - Press **S** to move the turtle backward.
  - Press **A** to turn the turtle left.
  - Press **D** to turn the turtle right.
  - Press **C** to reset the turtle's position.

- **Interactive Output**: A graphical window where the turtle responds in real time to user commands.
- **Event-driven Programming**: The program uses event listeners for real-time interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Run the script in your terminal or any Python IDE:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

4. Use your keyboard to move the turtle and interact with the application.

## Project Structure

This project consists of a single Python file that includes:

- Functions to handle movement and resetting of the turtle.
- Event listeners that map specific keys to their corresponding actions.

## Key Concepts Used

- **Event-driven programming**: The program reacts to user input via keyboard events.
- **Turtle graphics**: A Python library used for educational purposes to create simple, fun graphics.

## Demo

When you run the program, you'll see a window with the turtle. Use the keyboard controls to guide the turtle forward, backward, left, or right. Reset its position at any time by pressing **C**.
